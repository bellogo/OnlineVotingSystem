#Online Voting System
This Project was made under the assumption that The nigerian government is tired of using manual method for voting
their candidates due to the continual stress it creates and the high rate of election rigging.

With This project an Administrator when signed in can:

- register candidates,
- view all candidates,
- update candidate details,
- Delete candidates, 
- and even vote once if need be.

 voters can sign up using their personal information and a unique ID in this case an email address for simplification.

There also exists a timer which will count down to the end of the voting period and afterwards display the winner of the elections.
